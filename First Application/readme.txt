Make sure you have python installed in your system.
Open terminal/powershell/CMD and do "pip install django" if Django is not installed.
Open another terminal in the project directory( Directory where manage.py file is) and do "python manage.py runserver".
Server will start, open your browser and type in the URL bar "localhost:8000", it'll take you to the app.
